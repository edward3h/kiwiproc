== Framework Support

Kiwiproc uses only the Jakarta annotations `@Singleton` and `@Named`, so should work with any Dependency Injection framework that supports those.
It expects a `DataSource` to be injected, with a name matching that specified on the `@DAO` annotation.

For Spring, the `@Repository` and `@Qualifier` annotations are used instead.
