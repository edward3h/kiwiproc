# Query Helper*

*Please help come up with a better name.

## Overview

A compile-time framework for type-safe JDBC query usage. It is not an ORM.

Inspired by:
* [JDBI Declarative API](https://jdbi.org/#_declarative_api)
* [micronaut-data-jdbc](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-data/latest/guide/#dbc)
* [SQL Delight](https://github.com/cashapp/sqldelight)

## Databases

For now, _only_ Postgresql is supported. It's a "MVP".
